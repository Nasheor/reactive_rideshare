# PYTHON PROGRAM DEFINITION
#
# The knowledge a computer has of Python can be specified in 3 levels:
# (1) Prelude knowledge --> The computer has it by default.
# (2) Borrowed knowledge --> The computer gets this knowledge from 3rd party libraries defined by others
#                            (but imported by us in this program).
# (3) Generated knowledge --> The computer gets this knowledge from the new functions defined by us in this program.
#
# When launching in a terminal the command:
# user:~$ python3 this_file.py
# our computer first processes this PYTHON PROGRAM DEFINITION section of the file.
# On it, our computer enhances its Python knowledge from levels (2) and (3) with the imports and new functions
# defined in the program. However, it still does not execute anything.
