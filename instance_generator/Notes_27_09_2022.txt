Time horizon 500 units
Battery capacity is 100 units. 

100 vehicles





Assume we have 0.5 times the energy required => 5000 * 0.5 =  2.500 units
Assume we have 6.0 times the energy required => 5000 * 6.0 = 30.000 units




Start Mode => Time Horizon Unit 0 release 2,500 units
												         30,000 units

Spread => Small fraction per unit of time horizon. Each unit 2,500 / 500 => 5 units per time
                                                             30,000 / 500 => 60 units per time

The entire EV fleet 10 vehicles are spread among the number of SECs. 
SEC_1 => 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
SEC_2 => 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

First question is: what is the maximum battery capacity of all the vehicle fleet together. 


Fact 1: 
- 1000 trip petitions. 
- Average distance per trip = 5 blocks.
- Total distance = 5000 blocks.

Fact 2: 
- Every block takes on average 1 unit of battery capacity. 

Fact 3:
- Battery capacity is 100 units.
- On average, an EV covers a maximum of 20 trips. 

Playing numbers: 

- Number of EVs = 100, 300, 1000 ==> ???

- Assume we want a factor 1.0 on total battery of the EV fleet vs. total distance of all TPs. 
  I am going to be having EV fleet able to cover the total distance * 1.0 => 5000 * 1.0 = 5000 units. 
  Number of EV = total distance able to cover / battery of one single EV => 5000 / 100 = 50 EVs.


- Assume we want a factor 2.0 on total battery of the EV fleet vs. total distance of all TPs. 
  I am going to be having EV fleet able to cover the total distance * 2.0 => 5000 * 2.0 = 10000 units. 
  Number of EV = total distance able to cover / battery of one single EV => 10000 / 100 = 100 EVs.


- One set of experiments with 1.0 factor for the number of EVs and 0.5 factor for the energy we got. 
- One set of experiments with 2.0 factor for the number of EVs and 0.5 factor for the energy we got.
- One set of experiments with 1.0 factor for the number of EVs and 1.0 factor for the energy we got. 
- One set of experiments with 2.0 factor for the number of EVs and 1.0 factor for the energy we got.
- One set of experiments with 1.0 factor for the number of EVs and 2.0 factor for the energy we got. 
- One set of experiments with 2.0 factor for the number of EVs and 2.0 factor for the energy we got.
- One set of experiments with 1.0 factor for the number of EVs and 6.0 factor for the energy we got. 
- One set of experiments with 2.0 factor for the number of EVs and 6.0 factor for the energy we got.

One set of experiment => 10000 trip petitions, 300 trip petitions. 

Play as well with the number of SECs => 1, 2, 4, 8. 
Assume the energy produced in the city is divided equally among all SECs. So, if there is just 1 SEC, all the energy goes to it, 
if there are two SECs, then the energy is divided half and half, each half to each SEC, and so on. 
This will have an impact in the rate the EVs are being released.
